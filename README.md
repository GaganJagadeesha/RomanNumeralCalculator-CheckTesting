# RomanNumeralCalculator
# Conditions for exectuion: 1) Roman Numerals have to be given as highest numer first eg CMXIV for 904 they should not be represented as IVXCM which is an incorrect input. 2) During subtraction the higher number should be entered first and then the lower. 3) This program calculates with M D C L V AND I only.
# This repository includes the test code and all the realted files for roman numeral calculator.
# In this program Roman numerals are expaned to their lower forms to I and then concatenated together for addition. After conatenating the string is then compressed i.e represented in Roman Numeral form.
# For substraction, length of the expanded form is found out and which is then subtracted from the first number. After subtracting the length the string is then compressed i.e represented in Roman Numeral form.
